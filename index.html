    <p>Welcome to the UNO Mindfulness Club website!</p>
      <br>
    <p>
      At the UNO Mindfulness club, we practice (you guessed it) mindfulness.
      The club meets once a week during UNO's semester, and each meeting lasts for one hour.
      Each regular meeting is usually broken down into three sections which are split into 20 minutes each.
    </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      20 minutes of personal sharing | 20 minutes of meditation | 20 minutes of discussions or activities relating to mindfulness
      </p>

    <h2>What is Mindfulness?</h2>
    <p>Mindfulness is the practice of being aware.
        It is an ancient art that helps put us in touch with ourselves, life, and the present moment.
    There are countless benefits from being mindful, ranging from stress relief,
        to increased happiness, to a sense of inner peace, and more.</p>
        <br>
        <p>"Mindfulness is when you are truly there, mind and body together. You breathe in and out mindfully, 
          you bring your mind back to your body, and you are there. When your mind is there with your body, you are established in the present moment."
          <br>- Thich Nhat Hanh</p>
