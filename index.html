    <p> At the UNO Mindfulness club, we practice (you guessed it) mindfulness. 
        The club meets once a week during UNO's semester, and each meeting lasts for one hour. 
        Each regular meeting is usually broken down into three sections split into 20 minutes each. 
    <li> 20 minutes sharing mindfulness and how it relates to your life</li> 
    <li> 20 minutes of meditation</li>
    <li> 20 minutes of discussions or activites relating to mindfulness </li>
